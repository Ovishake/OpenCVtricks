# OpenCVtricks

Collection of Various Tricks using the OpenCV library that can help us solve a lot of problems.

**Personal Note:
Computer Vision is an awesome maths intensive subject. Although the focus nowadays is on deep learning algorithms especially CNN, but deep learning deserves special attention. Because it is useless to solve a problem using deep learning if it can be solved in easier less costly methods like that of OpenCV.
